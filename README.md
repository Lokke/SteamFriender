SteamFriender: Use OpenID and Steam API to grab user data.


SteamFriedner is a site I created t that utilizes OpenID to login to the Steam API in order to grab and store 
information about the user including their games, location and preferences. It will also show some basic server 
side techniques to keep track of games people are looking to play and which ones are the most popular.
