Steam Friender 1.0 by Aaron Uchytil

GOAL:
Create a website that utilizes OpenID to login to the Steam API in order to grab and store information about the user including their games, location and preferences. It will also show some basic server side techniques to keep track of games people are looking to play and which ones are the most popular. 

To configure, import steam_friender.sql into your MySQL database. Setup the includes/config.php to connect with the database.
